/*
Constants For Modbus Server/Client
    ----------------------------------
    
    This is the single location for storing default
values for the servers and clients.
*/


class Defaults {
    /* A collection of modbus default values

    .. attribute:: Port

    The default modbus tcp server port (502)

    .. attribute:: Retries

    The default number of times a client should retry the given
    request before failing (3)

    .. attribute:: RetryOnEmpty

    A flag indicating if a transaction should be retried in the
    case that an empty response is received. This is useful for
        slow clients that may need more time to process a requst.

    .. attribute:: Timeout

    The default amount of time a client should wait for a request
    to be processed (3 seconds)

    .. attribute:: Reconnects

    The default number of times a client should attempt to reconnect
    before deciding the server is down (0)

    .. attribute:: TransactionId

    The starting transaction identifier number (0)

    .. attribute:: ProtocolId

    The modbus protocol id.  Currently this is set to 0 in all
    but proprietary implementations.

    .. attribute:: UnitId

    The modbus slave addrss.  Currently this is set to 0x00 which
    means this request should be broadcast to all the slave devices
    (really means that all the devices should respons).

    .. attribute:: Baudrate

    The speed at which the data is transmitted over the serial line.
    This defaults to 19200.

    .. attribute:: Parity

    The type of checksum to use to verify data integrity. This can be
    on of the following::

    - (E)ven - 1 0 1 0 | P(0)
    - (O)dd  - 1 0 1 0 | P(1)
    - (N)one - 1 0 1 0 | no parity

    This defaults to (N)one.

    .. attribute:: Bytesize

    The number of bits in a byte of serial data.  This can be one of
    5, 6, 7, or 8. This defaults to 8.

    .. attribute:: Stopbits

    The number of bits sent after each character in a message to
    indicate the end of the byte.  This defaults to 1.

    .. attribute:: ZeroMode

    Indicates if the slave datastore should use indexing at 0 or 1.
    More about this can be read in section 4.4 of the modbus specification.

    .. attribute:: IgnoreMissingSlaves

    In case a request is made to a missing slave, this defines if an error
    should be returned or simply ignored. This is useful for the case of a
    serial server emulater where a request to a non-existant slave on a bus
    will never respond. The client in this case will simply timeout.
